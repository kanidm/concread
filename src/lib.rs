//! Concread - Concurrently Readable Datastructures
//!
//! Concurrently readable is often referred to as [Copy-On-Write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write), [Multi-Version-Concurrency-Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control)
//! or [Software Transactional Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_memory).
//!
//! These structures allow multiple readers with transactions
//! to proceed while single writers can operate. A reader is guaranteed the content
//! of their transaction will remain the same for the duration of the read, and readers do not block
//! writers from proceeding.
//! Writers are serialised, just like a mutex.
//!
//! You can use these in place of a RwLock, and will likely see improvements in
//! parallel throughput of your application.
//!
//! The best use is in place of mutex/rwlock, where the reader exists for a
//! non-trivial amount of time.
//!
//! For example, if you have a RwLock where the lock is taken, data changed or read, and dropped
//! immediately, this probably won't help you.
//!
//! However, if you have a RwLock where you hold the read lock for any amount of time,
//! writers will begin to stall - or inversely, the writer will cause readers to block
//! and wait as the writer proceeds.
//!
//! # Features
//! This library provides multiple structures for you to use. You may enable or disable these based
//! on our features.
//!
//! * `ebr` - epoch based reclaim cell
//! * `maps` - concurrently readable b+tree and hashmaps
//! * `arcache` - concurrently readable ARC cache
//! * `ahash` - use the cpu accelerated ahash crate
//!
//! By default all of these features are enabled. If you are planning to use this crate in a wasm
//! context we recommend you use only `maps` as a feature.
